      <Text p>
        HushDrop is a secure, end-to-end encrypted secret sharing service. It
        allows you to securely share secrets with other people, without having
        to worry about your data being compromised.

      <Text h3>How it works</Text>
      <Text p>
        When you share a secret, the data is encrypted directly on your device,
        meaning it never leaves your device unencrypted. The encrypted data is
        then securely stored on our server. The recipient can access the secret
        by entering the password and decrypting the data on their device. After
        the secret has been decrypted, it is deleted from our server and can no
        longer be accessed.
